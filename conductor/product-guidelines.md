# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice

- **Helpful and Intuitive:** The system should feel supportive and easy to navigate. Since much of the organization is automated (metadata extraction, vectorization), the interface should provide clear feedback without being intrusive.

## Prose Style

- **Concise and Direct:** User-facing text should be brief and purposeful. Avoid jargon and unnecessary filler to minimize cognitive load, allowing users to quickly "save and forget" links.

## Visual Identity and UI

- **Clean and Minimalist:** A focus on simplicity and white space. The UI should stay out of the way, making search results and saved content the primary focus.
- **Material UI Design:** Leverage Material Design principles for consistent, familiar, and functional components.

## AI and Privacy Communication

- **Utility-Focused:** Lead with the value of the search results and discovery. Detailed technical information about local AI processing (Ollama) and vector indexing (ArcadeDB) should be secondary, primarily residing in the developer or setup documentation.

## Brand Messaging

- **Core Value:** "The smartest way to organize your web discovery."
- **Focus:** Emphasize the ease of capturing and the power of effortless retrieval through semantic understanding.
